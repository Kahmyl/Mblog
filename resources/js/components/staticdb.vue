            body: 'The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is moving much more quickly to grant special ’emergency use authorization’ to equipment and tests that could help increase testing for the novel coronavirus in the U.S., which lags behind most countries in the world when it comes to tests conducted relative to the size of its population. One type of test just approved for use could help expand the availability of frontline testing in hospitals and at clinics where patients are receiving care – without requiring round-tripping to a dedicated diagnostics lab. Cepheid’s COVID-19 test, which the agency approved this week, also has the advantage of being able to be run either with or without use of a nasal swab, which is key because supplies of nasal swabs are taxed globally in light of the need for testing. It’s also a molecular, PCR-based test, with high rates of accuracy just like the lab-based testing that’s already in place across facilities in the U.S., but it uses the company’s GeneXpert machine (basically a diagnostics kit the size of an inkjet printer cartdrige lab in a box roughly the size of an inkjet printer) to produce results on-site. Cepheid says that around 23,000 of its GeneXpert micro-labs are already in use around the world, with around 5,000 of those located in the U.S. The company’s hardware has been running tests for the flu for years already, with high reliability rates. The new COVID-19 tests for the system will begin to be shipped out by the Sunnyvale-based molecular diagnostics company starting next week. Testing in the U.S. has increased over the past week, thanks in large part to widespread efforts to expand availability especially in hard-hit regions like New York State. But the need for more tests is still pressing, as the limits of availability mean that essentially only the most severe cases, often requiring confirmed contact tracing or proof of elevated risk, are being tested.Solutions like Cepheid’s, as well as other potential alternative test methods than can be done entirely at home, like Scanwell’s forthcoming test that looks for antibodies in a person’s blood, are much-needed if we hope to truly expand testing to a degree that it can properly inform any coronavirus mitigation strategy.',

            body: 'Right now the world is at war. But this is no ordinary war. It’s a fight with an organism so small we can only detect it through use of a microscope — and if we don’t stop it, it could kill millions of us in the next several decades. No, I’m not talking about COVID-19, though that organism is the one on everyone’s mind right now. I’m talking about antibiotic-resistant bacteria. You see, more than 700,000 people died globally from bacterial infections last year — 35,000 of them in the U.S. If we do nothing, that number could grow to 10 million annually by 2050, according to a United Nations report. The problem? Antibiotic overuse at the doctor’s office or in livestock and farming practices. We used a lot of drugs over time to kill off all the bad bacteria — but it only killed off most, not all, of the bad bacteria. And, as the famous line from Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park goes, “life finds a way.” Enter Felix, a biotech startup in the latest Y Combinator batch that thinks it has a novel approach to keeping bacterial infections at bay – viruses. Phage killing bacteria in a petri dish It seems weird in a time of widespread concern over the corona virus to be looking at any virus in a good light but as co-founder Robert McBride explains it, Felix’s  key technology allows him to target his virus to specific sites on bacteria. This not only kills off the bad bacteria but can also halt its ability to evolve and once more become resistant. But the idea to use a virus to kill off bacteria is not necessarily new. Bacteriophages, or viruses that can “infect” bacteria, were first discovered by an English researcher in 1915 and commercialized phage therapy began in the U.S. in the 1940’s through Eli Lilly and Company. Right about then antibiotics came along and Western scientists just never seemed to explore the therapy further. However, with too few new solutions being offered and the standard drug model not working effectively to combat the situation, McBride believes his company can put phage therapy back at the forefront. Already Felix has tested its solution on an initial group of 10 people to demonstrate its approach. Felix researcher helping cystic fibrosis patient Ella Balasa through phage therapy “We can develop therapies in less time and for less money than traditional antibiotics because we are targeting orphan indications and we already know our therapy can work in humans,” McBride told TechCrunch . “We argue that our approach, which re-sensitizes bacteria to traditional antibiotics could be a first line therapy.” Felix plans to deploy its treatment for bacterial infections in those suffering from cystic fibrosis first as these patients tend to require a near constant stream of antibiotics to combat lung infections. The next step will be to conduct a small clinical trial involving 30 people, then, as the scientific research and development model tends to go, a larger human trial before seeking FDA approval. But McBride hopes his viral solution will prove itself out in time to help the coming onslaught of antibiotic resistance. “We know the antibiotic resistant challenge is large now and is only going to get worse,” McBride said. “We have an elegant technological solution to this challenge and we know our treatment can work. We want to contribute to a future in which these infections do not kill more than 10 million people a year, a future we can get excited about.”',

This is not right. It’s not okay to get complacent,” he said in a nationwide televised appearance. More than 250 individuals have tested positive for COVID-19 in India so far. On Friday, India’s IT ministry issued an advisory to social media giants including Facebook,  ByteDance, Twitter, and Sharechat, to take immediate actions to remove or disable fake content around coronavirus. “Intermediaries are urged to initiate awareness campaign on their platforms for the users not to upload/ circulate any false news/misinformation concerning coronavirus which are likely to create panic among public and disturb the public order and social tranquility,” it said.

They’re among many celebrities in sport, music and film donating a “once-in-a-lifetime” fan experience and rare items in conjunction with the All In Challenge, by the All In Challenge Foundation. Donations will benefit a variety of American charitable organizations helping during the COVID-19 crisis, like America’s Food Fund, Meals on Wheel, No Kid Hungry and more. Most recently, it was announced that DiCaprio and Robert De Niro would join the challenge, offering a walk-on role in their upcoming movie, Killers of the Flower Moon. The lucky bidder will also win a lunch with the two veteran stars, a day on the set and an invite to the premiere. In a video shared to DiCaprio’s Instagram, they also challenged Matthew McConaughey, Ellen DeGeneres and Jamie Foxx to participate. Bieber has vowed to fly out to sing One Less Lonely Girl at the house of the person who garners the winning entry, per Rolling Stone. The challenge is the brainchild of Fanatics founder and Philadelphia 76ers partner Michael Rubin, in partnership with Alan Tisch and Gary Vaynerchuk. Rubin shared a post on Instagram introducing the challenge to the world, writing: “We’re launching the ALL-IN Challenge with the goal of uniting the sports, business and entertainment communities to start the largest digital fundraising movement ever by raising tens of millions of dollars or more to help provide food for the growing number of people in need that COVID-19 crisis has created.” “So I’m challenging every athlete, sports team owner, sports league, artist, celebrity and business titan to go all-in with me.” The biggest names in sports, from Magic Johnson and Peyton Manning to Alex Rodriguez, are part of the fundraiser too.',

            body: 'Paul McCartney called into The Howard Stern Show on Tuesday to speak not only about how he was coping with being in quarantine during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but also his thoughts on “wet markets” in China. Wet markets are open marketplaces with stalls selling fresh meat and fish. They’re considered a traditional form of food retail in large Asian cities and often regarded, as McCartney pointed out, to be “unsanitary.” After discussing the era of the novel coronavirus and self-isolation, host Howard Stern asked the former Beatle for his opinion on the Asian markets — which are the heavily suspected to be the source of the Wuhan, China-spawned illness. McCartney, 77, openly shared his beliefs that the Chinese government should ban wet markets after suggesting that the SARS epidemic and Avian flu among “all sorts of over” viruses were initially brought on by their “unsanitary practices.” Sir Paul McCartney performs live on stage at the O2 Arena during his Freshen Up tour, on Dec. 16, 2018 in London, England.

Jim Dyson/Getty Images “I really hope that this will mean that the Chinese government —  who you say ‘have got power’ — says ‘OK, guys, we have really got to get super hygienic around here,” said McCartney. “Let’s face it, it is a little bit medieval, eating bats,” he added, referring to the rumours that COVID-19 was brought upon after the unknown “patient zero” ate a bat from a wet market.

While not explicitly backing McCartney’s recent claim, Dr. Bogoch added, “That’s what happened with the SARS outbreak in 2002,” suggesting COVID-19 may indeed have stemmed from a wet market in Wuhan. ‘Many investigations’ taking place in China about animal-source of novel coronavirus  ‘Many investigations’ taking place in China about animal-source of novel coronavirus “Have you stopped eating bats, Paul?” Stern asked McCartney jokingly. “Yeah… but Ozzy hasn’t,” replied the rock icon, referring to heavy metal pioneer Ozzy Osbourne, who bit the head off of a bat while performing onstage in 1982. He supposedly thought it was a toy.

Paul has that power,” chimed in co-host Robin Quivers. McCartney then agreed with the co-hosts saying that maybe if they banded together and protested the wet markets that they may eventually be shut down by the Chinese government.

Not just us. They don’t need all these people dying.” “What’s it for?” he questioned. “All these medieval practices… They just need to clean up their act.” The Yesterday singer then admitted he was optimistic that the results of the COVID-19 pandemic might “lead to” the demise of wet markets. “If this doesn’t, I don’t know what will,” he continued. “When you’ve got the obscenity of some of the stuff that’s going on there and what comes out of it, they might as well be letting off atomic bombs, because it’s affecting the whole world.”',

            body: 'American punk icon Jimmy Webb died on Tuesday after a battle with cancer. He was 62.The New York City-based businessman was best known as the manager and buyer of Trash and Vaudeville — the iconic, Manhattan-based rock and roll fashion boutique — between 2000 and 2016.After the world-renowned East Village landmark relocated, Webb launched his own business I Need More in 2016 as a new place to outfit his seemingly endless list of musician friends, which included the Ramones, Iggy Pop and Beyoncé.A close friend of Webb’s, Heart Montalbano, revealed he had been fighting cancer, Rolling Stone reported on Tuesday.I Need More issued a statement to Instagram on Wednesday morning confirming Webb’s death.“We lost an angel yesterday,” the store wrote. “Jimmy Webb is and will forever be loved by everyone. Jimmy is bringing people together even after his passing. This is what he would’ve wanted.“Everyone has their own story and we hope that you can share them with us so that we can, together, mourn his passing… We will always remember Jimmy and celebrate the love he shared with us.”An outpouring of tributes to Webb began pouring in over social media in wake of the news.Mourning the loss of the outgoing, personality-filled individual were legendary rock musicians Alice Cooper, Joan Jett, Slash and Duff McKagan from Guns N’ Roses, Sebastian Bach and Debbie Harry of Blondie, among other loyal buyers.Here’s what some rock legends had to say about Jimmy Webb:“The death of Jimmy Webb will be breaking many hearts today,” tweeted legendary rock photographer Mick Rock.“He was a beautiful man of rare soul and grace with a huge heart.

Hikari Yokoyama/WireImageThe store spanned two floors of New York City’s historic Hamilton-Holly House on St. Mark’s Place for four decades. While it was one business, the main floor was dedicated to “vaudeville” attire, whereas the basement focused on the “trash” style of rock ‘n’ roll.“It’s here because of truth and spirit,” he added. “Just like Iggy Pop giving it his best every night and going all the way until everything in your body is broken except your soul and rock ’n’ roll.”Webb was raised in the small town of Wynantskill, N.Y. After graduating high school in only three years and enrolling in a Connecticut-based community college, Webb grew tired of his routine lifestyle and made the abrupt decision to hitchhike down to Florida, according to the New Yorker.It was there where he met a couple of vacationing New Yorkers — who he quickly befriended — and moved back to the Big Apple in the ’70s. It was then that Webb got a job “delivering cocktails in a gay bar.”He credited that job for kicking off his rock ‘n’ roll lifestyle, to “dance and live,” adding that it inspired him to run “off into the streets by [himself] with all the other runaway boys. No fear.”Webb was homeless for a while as he struggled with addiction. He later overcame those problems and made the name that he is known for now in the fashion industry after joining Trash and Vaudeville.Webb is remembered by many as an energetic, positive man, a “warm soul,” “a ragged ray of sunshine” and the “heart and soul of New York City rock n’ roll fashion.”',
